    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. **K-Nearest Neighbors.**\n",
    "<p>Example: When zoologists finds a new species, they often compare it with other species to find its \"relatives\" based on multiple features, and then classify it. By using k-nearest neighbors, they can easily load already known species into memory and compare these animals and define them based on their feature distance. </p>\n",
    "<p>Pro: Short training time; support non-linear solutions; easy and with few hyperparameters to tune. If the traing data is much larger than number of features, KNN is a good choice to start with. </p>\n",
    "<p>Con: Longer query time, memory intensive, can be fooled by irrelevant attributes. K needs to be wisely selected. </p>\n",
    "<p>Reason: As in the dataset have a big amount (40k+) and we don't have much memory constraint, knn is a good start point to see if we can make good predictions, since it's easy to train and predict. </p>\n",
    "<p />\n",
    "2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM).**\n",
    "<p>Example: A search engine needs to tag articles into categories (politics, entertainments, etc.) based on their text. A natural choice would be naive bayes for text analysis, but we can also use SVM to do it too. In this case, the model can be complex, nonliner, with large features. Using SVM and kurnel trick, we can maximize the distinctions among documents while handing certain outliers. </p>\n",
    "<p>Pro: very accurate and tends not to overfit data. Very fast. Memory efficient. Performs well when there are large features and lesser training data. </p>\n",
    "<p>Con: Need to invest time on the model, since the hyperparameters need to be tuned before the model performs well. </p>\n",
    "<p>Reason: Based on our information, we have many features and many of them are likely to be related (like education_level\tand education-num for example), and there are some outliers as well (even though we've used logorithmic transformation to make them less savient), we can try to use SVM to see how the model performs. </p>\n",
    "<p />\n",
    "3. **AdaBoost.**\n",
    "<p>Example: An e-commercial website intends to recommend certain items to customers. In order to determine if a customer is likely to buy that item, it needs to make a prediction based on the customers information. As in this case the relationship is less likely linear, and there are a lot of features and many of them are mutually dependent, we can use AdaBoost in order to separate the data. With different weak learners, each focuses on certain features the customers have; then get the error points, weight them and input into the next learner that focuses on other features. In the end, by minimizing the exponential loss, we can get a strong classifier and use it to classify customers. </p>\n",
    "<p>Pro: very strong model to increase accuracy and may not to overfit data compared to a single decision trees model. </p>\n",
    "<p>Con: time and computational expensive. Tends to be complex (and sometimes may overfit data as well). </p>\n",
    "<p>Reason: From the features we can see if we use a single decision trees, it may not learn the internal signal of features well (or overfitting); and if we can combine them together using boosting, we may reduce the error and get a better model. </p>\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "<p> From the graph above, we can see: On training data, accuracy and F-score from high to low is: KNN, SVC, AdaBoost. On testing data, accuracy and F-score from high to low is: Adaboost, SVC, KNN, which is exactly the opposite. Although lowest, KNN still performs much better with higher scores than naive predictor calculated on Question 1, which means all three models are effective in terms of predicting new data. However, if we look at these three, KNN and SVC tends to be more overfitting than Adaboost since they perform better on training data than testing data, especially when more training data coming in (from 1% to 10% to 100%), accuracy scores or F-scores for KNN and SVC (especially KNN) do not tend to converge by showing a gap between them, which is an obvious symbol of overfitting. For execution time, on training phase, SVC takes significantly longer time than the other two; on testing phase, SVC still takes a long time, and KNN's query time ramps up to be the highest. This is understandable, since KNN doesn't need to train, but on prediction, it needs to calculate the distance of each point to all training points and find k nearest neighbors. For Adaboost, no matter it's training or testing phase, it takes the shortest time. For the algorithm's suitability for the data, as KNN needs to load all data into memory and takes a long time to calculate on prediction, it might not be very suitable even though it's the simplest model among the three. SVC tends to take a much long time to fit the model, but it still doesn't perform as well as Adaboost, although better than KNN. Adaboost, even though its scores on training set are a little lower than the other two, its performance on the testing set is the best, with testing scores significantly higher than the other two, and it takes the shortest time to train and test as well. Also, as a lot of the features are categorical, Adaboost can be a good choice since it combines a lot of decision trees by default, which are good for categorical features.</p>\n",
    "<p> Based on the discussion above, I choose Adaboost among these three models.</p>"

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "<p>Adaboost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a collection of classification models that work together. For example, if we think each model as a judge, and here we have 5 judges to predict if someone earns more than 50k among 100 people. They are lining up to make decision one after another. Each person only has a limited knowledge that can help them to predict just a little better than random guessing. At training time, each judge knows the result of the predictions from their previous judge. For instance, if judge 1 predicts 60 persons right, with 40 wrong, judge two will pay more attention to make those 40 right, and she makes more mistakes on some other 35 people, then judge three will try his best to correct both judge 1 and judge 2's mistakes. In the end, after each judge learns from their previous learners, all together, they make the error less and less and combine into a good guesser. At prediction time, as we can see, each judge has a different error rate. We will weigh them based on how good they are, and calculate the final decision based on each of their weighted results, and eventually get a prediction. In the real world, to make the model less prone to overfit, we don't let each judge learn from the whole dataset. On the contrary, each of them only take a random sample of the data. However, when they know certain people have been predicted wrong by their previous fellows, those people are more likely to get selected and corrected in their hand. This is called Adaboost.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In other words, as it combines multiple weak learners and each learner tries to correct its predecessor by adapting (weighing) more on the underfitted data point by the previous models and focucing more on predicting those higher weighed points right each time, it makes the model better and better and eventually yield a good performance on the predictions.</p>\n",

Education-num is an indirect indicator of education-level. Then age is important in the sense that the older people are, the more experienced and senior they are in their position, which, in many cases, turns into higher pay.

    "**Answer:** Compared to the five features here, I've got education-num and age right. Education-num is the highest. It makes sense. Hours-per-week ranks second. The more hours people work, the more they make. However, the reason why I didn't select this one was because sometimes people work parttime. In order to make more money, they tend to work more hours, but their wages are not necessarily higher than annually-paid employees. But at least hours-per-week should be important in predicting their income. I missed capital-gain and capital-loss. If people make more money, they can spare it to investment. In turn, they should expect more on capital-gain or capital-loss. Otherwise, people do not invest at all. So these two factors are related to people's income as well. It does not include ocupation, education-level and race. I think part of the reasons is that 50k is a common average salary amount of Americans (depending on the area). As a result, almost people with all ocupation, education-level and race can reach this number under different conditions. In this case, these three factors are not that important as those five showed in the graph above."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

Considering we have a lot more data and features, it is always a trade-off to spend more time to train and get higher scores, as opposed to spending less time to train (by reducing the feature space) and sacrifice a little on performance. If training time was a factor, I would consider using the reduced data as my training set."
